# Java Input Methods Demo

This Java application demonstrates the use of various input methods to read user input and calculate the factorial of a number. The program showcases five different input methods: Command Line Arguments, `Scanner`, `BufferedReader`, `DataInputStream`, and `Console`.

## Features

The `InputMethodsDemo` class provides a simple interface for users to input a number in various ways, and then calculates and displays the factorial of the entered number.

### Input Methods Demonstrated

- **Command Line Arguments**: Uses arguments passed to the program at launch to perform calculations.
- **Scanner**: Utilizes the `Scanner` class to read input from the console.
- **BufferedReader**: Employs `BufferedReader` in combination with `InputStreamReader` to read console input.
- **DataInputStream**: Makes use of `DataInputStream` for reading input directly from the data stream.
- **Console**: Takes advantage of the `Console` class for reading input in a secure and interactive manner.

### Functionality

- The program prompts the user to choose an input method.
- Depending on the selected method, it then asks the user to input a number.
- The program calculates the factorial of the given number and displays the result.
